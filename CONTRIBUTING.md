# Contributing to Nimble Charts

Welcome to nimble_charts! [Nimblesite](https://www.nimblesite.co/) is excited that you're interested in contributing to this project. This is a community-maintained fork of the original charts_flutter library, which is no longer maintained by Google.

## About Nimble Charts

This is a continuation of the charts_flutter project. We aim to keep this charting library up-to-date and create the most stable for of the original. There are already a lot of widget tests, and we will continue to add widget and integration tests until there is very high test coverage.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes to new features. Here are some ways you can help:

1. **Reporting Issues**: If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

2. **Submitting Pull Requests**: Feel free to submit pull requests for any improvements you'd like to make.

3. **Improving Documentation**: Help us keep our documentation clear, up-to-date, and comprehensive.

4. **Sharing Ideas**: We're always open to new ideas for features or improvements. Share these in the Discussions section of our GitHub repository.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/nimble_charts.git`
3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style in the project. You need to abide by the rules of the [austerity](https://pub.dev/packages/austerity) package.

## Testing

Ensure that your contributions include appropriate tests and that all existing tests pass. 

Unit tests are not enough. All UI changes require widget tests, and even better if those widget tests double as integration tests.

It's sually a good idea to capture at least one golden of the charts, and there are plenty of examples of that in the existing tests.
